## Imperative

Imperative programming solves problems by laying out a series of steps. The steps are executed from the first to the last in order.

## Functional

Functional programming solves problems by passing values from function to function. In general, functional programmers avoid assigning variables, since they're a source of complexity in a program. Functional programming is suited to parallel programming (programming for multiple cores on a CPU).

## Object-oriented

Object-oritended programs cobine functions and data into an object. OO programming is useful when creating friendly user interfaces in libraries and when organizing projects that a lot of coders work on simultaneously.
